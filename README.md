You'll need Firefox and Tree Style Tabs (TST)[1] installed as well as some of the TST extensions. Here I'm showing "TST indent line"[2] and "TST Bookmark subpanel"[3]
The config file is totally optional and is mostly for personal use, it stores keyboard/mouse shortcuts and tab behavior. 

A little demo of how this mods TST.

*  it minimizes and expands over the web page
*  shows "tab lines" to better show tab hiearchy when expanded 
*  it has an pulsing animation for sound.
*  it has an integrated bookmarks menu, nice because TST takes the place of the bookmarks bar.
